[[国内的小伙伴请看更详细的中文说明]](https://github.com/woshidandan/Image-Color-Aesthetics-Assessment/blob/main/README_CN.md)This repo contains the official implementation and the new dataset ICAA17K of the **ICCV 2023** paper.

# Largest Color-oriented Dataset: ICAA17K &nbsp;<a href=""><img width="48" src="https://github.com/woshidandan/Image-Color-Aesthetics-Assessment/assets/15050507/94354c2b-c70e-4d31-bc40-4a2c76d671ff"></a>
* Existing IAA datasets primarily focus on evaluating the holistic quality of images and lack of detailed color annotations, with limited color types or combinations. Specifically, these datasets exhibit serious selection bias. e.g., about 50% images of the AVA dataset are “black and white” images, which outnumber other colors by 10 to 100 times, and the PCCD and SPAQ datasets have few images of “pink” and “violet” colors. Therefore, these IAA datasets are not suitable for ICAA tasks and cannot support the generalization of ICAA models well. To address the above issue, we try to develop a specialized and color-oriented dataset the first time. To the best of our knowledge, our ICAA17K dataset is the largest, as well as most densely annotated ICAA dataset with a diverse range of color types and image collection devices.
